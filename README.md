# StuTor - A student tutor managment system 

Software Engineering Project

Works in a simillar way as careeem or other location utilizing apps. 
The tutor may register himself, add his location, add his avaiable timmings and subjects he wants to teach.
A student may search for a tutor based on various criteria that have been specified such as
timmings, subjects or location or a combination to see avaiable tutors. Supports messaging between students and
tutors but not among them selves. Also features contracts where by a tutor forms a contract with a student and specfied 
the subject and times that have agreed for their class. This causes the time bloc to be blocked off from the tutors avaiable 
timmings so as to improve searches based on available timmings. Also features brokers which can contact both students and tutors
but cannot create contracts and can act as intermediates.
